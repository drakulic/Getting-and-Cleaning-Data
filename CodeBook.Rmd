# Data Set Information:

# The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

# The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

# Check the README.md file for further details about this dataset.


# Attribute Information:

# For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
# - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
# - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
# - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
# - Its activity label. 
# - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

# Activity labels:
# 1 WALKING
# 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
# 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
# 4 SITTING
# 5 STANDING
# 6 LAYING

# Data cleaning and transformation is decribed in README.md, I will only briefly repeat
# some of the information:
## download data from
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## unzip it at your working directory
## it will create directoy called "UCI HAR Dataset"
## in that directory there are two other directories: "test" and "train",
## as well as labels of variour columns of the data in txt files

## create a data frame "subject" by reading subject_test.txt, which has rows of a subject's number,
## and name the column "subject"
## create a data frame "activity" by reading y_test.txt, which has rows of an activity's number,
## and name the column "activity"
## change the numbers in activity data frame into textual activities listed in "activity_labels.txt"
## merge two data frames into one (subject and activity into dat1)
## read X_test data with 561 columns
## get the names of the features (which will be column names of X_test data)
# rows should be columns, so we will transpose rows and columns, and get just the names of the features
## rename the columns of X_test data with the column names of the features from features.txt
## get the index of columns that have "mean()" in them, and also "meanFreq()
## get the index of columns that have "std()" in them
## combine those indices into one
## sort the indices
## these are the indices we need in our data
## the data set with columns of needed data of mean, and std computations
## merge subject + activity (dat1), and X_test_mean_std
## just to check the final result: nrow(X_test_merged) gives me 2947,
## ncol(X_test_merged) gives me 81, so the test merged data frame is 2947 x 81

## Do the same for the train data

## just to check the final result: nrow(X_train_merged) gives me 7352,
## ncol(X_train_merged) gives me 81, so the train merged data frame is 7352 x 81

## merging the test and the training sets should give me (2947 + 7352) x 81 data frame
## i.e. 10299 x 81
## nrow(X_final) gives me 10299, which is as expected, ncol(X_final) is 81 as well

## empty data frame for tidy data for future storage there
# the data is split by subject, activity, and other variables, so it computes
# the mean of each variable for each subject and his/her activity,
# e.g. subject 1, activity 1, all means of variables; subject 2, activity 1, means,
# up to last subject, activity 1
# then, it starts with subject 1, activity 2 ..., last s, act 2 and so on
# nrow(X_tidy) = 79, ncol(X_tidy) = 180

# output with row.names=F so the data is properly aligned in MS Excel, but the row names
# are, of course, missing
# output with row.names=T so the data is NOT properly aligned in MS Excel
